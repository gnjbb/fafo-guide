2. say: **"run the fafo guide workflow"**
3. follow the prompts (click buttons, minimal typing required)

## what it does

| phase | duration | what happens |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| vibe check | 3 min | understand who you are, what you want to learn |
| spark hunt | 10 min | explore 90+ prompts across 17 categories |
| pain decomposition | 5 min | *conditional* — convert "i hate x" into buildable spec |
| reality forge | 5 min | pressure-test into something buildable |
| ship sheet | 2 min | get your battle plan |

## output
